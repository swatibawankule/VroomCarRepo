<div class="headerInner"> <span class="hederContent">The Vroomer level</span></div>
<div class="wrapperInner"> <span class="contentHeading">The Vroomcar Community</span><br>
  The vroomcar.in community represents the users who are registered with vroomcar.in and have used the services offered by vroomcar.in at any time in past or are using it in current time.<br>
  <br>
  <span class="contentHeading">The Vroomer Ratings</span><br>
  The Vroomer ratings/comments(coming soon) are the ratings provided by the co-traveler to the car owner with whom the co-traveler have traveled at any time in past. The ratings indicates the past experience of the co-traveler with a particular car owner. We at Vroomcar.in, strongly recommend you to provide the star ratings and the comments so that it can be beneficial for the other co-traveler in future. Consider giving the ratings, as you will also need those in future for other co-traveler, indirectly helping the community.<br>
  <br>
  <span class="contentHeading">The Vroomer Levels</span><br>
  Apart from the user ratings and comments, we at vroomcar.in make sure we provide the co-traveler with some reference about the car owner. For the same purpose we at vroomcar.in have devised 'The Vroomer Levels'. This indicates the overall experience of the car owner. <br>
  <span class="contentHeading">Various Vroomer levels are:</span><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Novice<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Seasoned<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; 3. The Vroomer<br>
  <br>
  <span class="contentHeading">Parameters to define Vroomer Levels:</span><br>
  1. Distance traveled via vroomcar.in(calculated by rides offered)<br>
  2. Number of trips offered via Vroomcar.in<br>
  3. % of positive star ratings received (To be implemented soon). Ratings will be defined at the scale of 1 to 5. <br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; a. 2 and below is unsatisfactory<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; b. 3 and above is good.<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp; c. 5 is awesome.<br>
  <br>
  Other than this, we always make sure that the profile of both the car owner and the co-traveler is 100% complete. This is considering the security aspect. Unless you complete your profile 100%, you cannot find or offer a ride.<br>
  <br>
  <span class="contentHeading">Explanation of the parameters:</span><br>
  The parameter's which are considered for providing the Vroomer levels are explained below.<br>
  <br>
  <span class="contentHeading">1. Distance Traveled:</span><br>
  The experience of the car owner can be directly matched through the distance he/she has traveled. We don't decide the experience level just based on the number of trip (though it's also important), as some trip can be as short as 100 KMS and some trips can be as long as 1000 KMS.<br>
  The division of Vroomer levels based on the Distance traveled is indicated below:<br>
  <br>
  <span class="contentHeading">&nbsp;&nbsp; Novice</span> - 0 KMS - 500 KMS<br>
  <span class="contentHeading">&nbsp;&nbsp; Seasoned</span> - 500 KMS - 3000 KMS<br>
  <span class="contentHeading">&nbsp;&nbsp; The Vroomer</span> - 3000+ KMS<br>
  <br>
  <span class="contentHeading">2. Number of trips offered:</span><br>
  The comfortness of the car owner can also be judged by checking the frequency with which he is offering the rides. The frequently the car owner travels, the more comfortable you can be with him.<br>
  The division of levels based on the rides offered is indicated below:<br>
  <br>
  Number of trips<br>
  <span class="contentHeading">&nbsp;&nbsp; Novice</span>- 1,<br>
  <span class="contentHeading">&nbsp;&nbsp; Seasoned</span> - 2 - 5,<br>
  <span class="contentHeading">&nbsp;&nbsp; The Vroomer</span> - 5+<br>
  <br>
  <span class="contentHeading">3. Ratings(To be implemented soon)</span><br>
  <br>
  <span class="contentHeading">Advantages of being a vroomer</span><br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;a. A Vroomer gets his seats occupied faster, because of the trust and Vroomer logo(Coming soon).<br>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;b. You get better networking as you are trusted by Vroomer Levels.<br>
